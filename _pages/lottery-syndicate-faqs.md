As for an example, a 2-ball match may give your syndicate a £2.70 wins. In a syndicate of 10 people, each syndicate players will get 27 pence each. This is considered as a low value winning. For low value winnings, you will get a bonus draw that gives you free lottery lines instead of cash. There is no option to convert your bonus draw into cash winning at this point of time.</div>

<div id="eighteenth" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

There will never be more than 49 players in a syndicate at one time, so if there is a £50m win, you will still walk away a millionaire and more! In fact, often over time the syndicate size can decrease and at the moment on average we pay out cash wins to each player as approximately a quarter e.g. if the win is £10 each player in the syndicate gets approximately £2.50 each.

You can check your syndicate size in the Members Area.

<div class="panel-body">

<strong>What is the Monthly £300 Prize Draw?</strong> The prize draw gives all active Lotto Social customers a chance to win a £300 Amazon voucher or an iPad every month! <strong>How does it work?</strong> All Lotto Social customers, as long as they have been a member for at least four consecutive weeks, will be automatically entered into the monthly prize draw. Basically, this means that you need to have played with Lotto Social for at least 4 weeks or have spent at least £18 to be entered into the prize draw. After this, you’ll be entered into the draw every month for as long as you’re a member! <strong>How do I know if I’ve won and what are the prizes?</strong> The winner will be contacted by email – the email address that you used to sign up – around the beginning of each month; so keep an eye on your emails! If a claim hasn’t been made, we will follow up with a phone call to remind the winner to claim their prize. The winner will also get a special message on their members’ area when they log in, to show them how to claim their prize. In the winner’s email, we will provide a special link to claim their prize, where they can choose between a £300 Amazon Voucher or an iPad. You can find out more <a href="/terms-and-conditions-for-lottery-syndicate-service/" target="_blank">here</a>. <strong>What can I do to increase my chances of winning?</strong> Just keep playing in your lucky Lotto Social syndicate! For extra chances to win, why not join another Lotto Social syndicate to get more lines per week and more bang for your buck?

Here’s what one of our prize draw winners said when she got her prize: <em>“I cant believe I have actually won something. I never win anything, never have in my whole life so let hope this is the start of something good. Thanks so much. You’re one in a million.” </em> – Wendy Waring, prize draw winner, 2012.

<div id="fifteenth" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

A bonus credit is given to players with a low value winning of 60 pence or less each. Depending on the syndicate size, a 2 or 3 balls match may result in a low value win. As for an example, a 2-ball match may give your syndicate a £2.70 wins. In a syndicate of 10 people, each syndicate players will get 27 pence each. This is considered as a low value win. For low value winnings, you will be given the option to convert your cash winnings into bonus credit which is usually 4 times the value of your cash winnings. You can then use your bonus credit to buy more lottery lines.

There will never be more than 49 players in a syndicate at one time, so if there is a £50m win, you will still walk away a millionaire and more! In fact, often over time the syndicate size can decrease and at the moment on average we pay out cash wins to each player as approximately a quarter e.g. if the win is £10 each player in the syndicate gets approximately £2.50 each. You can check your syndicate size in the Members Area under “Tickets”.

One of the syndicates will be your main syndicate club and the tickets assigned to this syndicate will be entered into the selected draws throughout the duration of your lottery syndicate subscription service.

The other syndicate may represent a gifting offer that expires after a selected draw. You will find more details about this in the Welcome Email that we sent to you upon registration.

This could be due to billing issue on your account. Please also check which offer you’ve signed up to. On selected offers such as our discounted offer on your 1st draw, we may not initiate your recurring payment until the following week.

<strong>What is the Monthly £300 Prize Draw?</strong>
The prize draw gives all active Lotto Social customers a chance to win a £300 Amazon voucher or an iPad every month!

<strong>How does it work?</strong>
All Lotto Social customers, as long as they have been a member for at least four consecutive weeks, will be automatically entered into the monthly prize draw. Basically, this means that you need to have played with Lotto Social for at least 4 weeks or have spent at least £18 to be entered into the prize draw. After this, you’ll be entered into the draw every month for as long as you’re a member!

<strong>How do I know if I’ve won and what are the prizes?</strong>
The winner will be contacted by email – the email address that you used to sign up – around the beginning of each month; so keep an eye on your emails! If a claim hasn’t been made, we will follow up with a phone call to remind the winner to claim their prize. The winner will also get a special message on their members’ area when they log in, to show them how to claim their prize. In the winner’s email, we will provide a special link to claim their prize, where they can choose between a £300 Amazon Voucher or an iPad. You can find out more here.

<strong>What can I do to increase my chances of winning?</strong>
Just keep playing in your lucky Lotto Social syndicate! For extra chances to win, why not join another Lotto Social syndicate to get more lines per week and more bang for your buck?

<strong>Here’s what one of our prize draw winners said when she got her prize:</strong>
“I cant believe I have actually won something. I never win anything, never have in my whole life so let hope this is the start of something good. Thanks so much. You’re one in a million.” – Wendy Waring, prize draw winner, 2012.
