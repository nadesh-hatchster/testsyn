One of the great things about playing the National Lottery with Lotto Social is that you do not have to remember to buy your Lotto and EuroMillions tickets again or to check to see if you have won. It is all done automatically and you will receive the weekly lottery results via email.

Once registered, your lines and login details will be shown on the page and sent to you via email for safe keeping.

For the duration of your subscription all information, claim references and results will be sent to you via email.

Don't forget to add support&lt;at&gt;lotto-social.com to your address book to ensure that your results and claim reference numbers arrive in your inbox.

Once the National Lottery results &amp; EuroMillions results are published we will notify you of the winning lottery numbers by email. This way, you will never miss the lottery results or forget to claim your winnings again.
