[vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]There has been a sudden influx amongst the wealthy to invest in a second and even third property, whether it’s rented or bought, they’re still buying, buying, buying!. If you won the lottery would you spend your winnings on a luxurious pad abroad?! The biggest in the industry are Airbnb with a huge property database booming with the most luxurious real estate in the world

<strong>Airbnb says:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>There has been a growth of 163% in one bedroom properties listed in London at over £1,000 per night.</li>
	<li>The growth in properties with luxury amenities (i.e. gyms &amp; swimming pools) has risen by 53% in the UK and 78% in Tokyo</li>
</ol>

Airbnb aren’t the only people getting a slice of the action, villas.com has more than 318,200 holiday rentals worldwide on it’s books! If you want all the added extras then onefinestay.com is certainly for you, they even supply linen and toiletries to each property. These companies allow the wealthy house owners to make big cash online by renting out their second homes. Some of the real estate that is on offer is too much to handle, villas.com is advertising a luxury suite in Santorini with a plunge pool and magnificent views for a not so bargain £445 per night.

If travelling abroad isn’t for you, then why not set up camp in a top floor Penthouse suite in London Kensington, these go for as much as £1150 PER night… this is certainly for those with a elegant eye looking to splash the cash. Kensington has some amazing nightlife and eateries on offer and who knows you may bump into the cast of Made of Chelsea… ooh exciting.

I guess for some of us a Penthouse just isn’t big enough for a week away, so why not grab a private island escape in Brazil for a steal at £450 per night. The crystal clear waters and dazzling scenery should be enough to entice the most wealthy of travellers.
