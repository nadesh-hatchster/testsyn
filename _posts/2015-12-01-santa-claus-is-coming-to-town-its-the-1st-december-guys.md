[vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]Christmas is just round the corner my <a href="/win-lottery-syndicates/?OL=8&amp;TP1=blog&amp;TP2=&amp;IP=&amp;Prosub_ID=2257&amp;a_bid=dc7c5227">lovely lottery lovers</a> and we thought it'd be fun to show you some of the most extravagant luxuries around at this time of the year. I guess if you do win the lottery this week it would only be right to have a right royal affair for the family this crimbo.

So lets kick things off with a classic...The almighty advent calendar! It is the <a href="/win-lottery-syndicates/?OL=8&amp;TP1=blog&amp;TP2=&amp;IP=&amp;Prosub_ID=2257&amp;a_bid=dc7c5227">festive season</a> and we all know the first thing we do when it hits December 1st, open up the first door of course to see what's in store - I guess we're all still big kids at heart. How about this year you try an advent calendar a little out of the ordinary of your usual choccy filled one! Harrod's are stocking a £9,000 advent calendar, but sorry to tell you guys they'll be no chocolate behind the doors this year (probably good for the waistline anyways LOL). However, this calendar has 24 delightful ornaments behind each door and you certainly won't want to get rid after december 25th, this baby will be worth a fortune in years to come!

Right, so we have the advent calendar, so what's next? Well the tree of course, a tree is the <a href="/win-lottery-syndicates/?OL=8&amp;TP1=blog&amp;TP2=&amp;IP=&amp;Prosub_ID=2257&amp;a_bid=dc7c5227">ultimate centrepiece</a> of any home in the festive period. And here we have the most outrageous beauty around, it stands 13ft tall in the Emirates Palace Hotel in Abu Dhabi, unveiled at costing a whopping £11M it certainly does look the part. This beauty is decorated with 181 diamonds, sapphires, pearls and various other precious stones! Wouldn't it be great to have this work of art standing tall in your house...However, I'm sure unless you have a huge mansion with 14ft ceilings it's not quite going to fit in, maybe a downsize is required guys!

The absolute showstopper of the 25th December is that gigantic dinner we all delve into, leaving us all feeling sluggish and tired after, but oh we do it again year after year! Well this year, London Chef, Ben Spalding, has created the most lavish menu for those willing to spend BIG bucks! For just four people it will cost a whopping £125,000 to dine, this menu includes a £37,000 bottle of Piper Heidisieck 1907 Champagne, £6,000 gold leaf and Almas caviar at £5,000 - these are just the tip of the iceberg for this <a href="/win-lottery-syndicates/?OL=8&amp;TP1=blog&amp;TP2=&amp;IP=&amp;Prosub_ID=2257&amp;a_bid=dc7c5227">extravagant feast</a>. And Spalding is still keeping ever so humble around the time for giving, he will be donating 80% of his fees to Cancer Research UK and Hospitality action.

And finally, what's a good Christmas without a few prezzies ay, but we all know how it is to buy for certain people year after year. So why not get them a mixture of bits and bobs, how does a hamper sound? <a href="/win-lottery-syndicates/?OL=8&amp;TP1=blog&amp;TP2=&amp;IP=&amp;Prosub_ID=2257&amp;a_bid=dc7c5227">The most expensive hamper</a> around is a grand £85,000 - this includes £6,000 caviar, the most decadent truffles costing £500 and an array of exquisite condiments, what's not to like?
