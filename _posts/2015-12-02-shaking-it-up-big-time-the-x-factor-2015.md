[vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<span style="font-weight: 400;">Well it’s official we know christmas isn’t that far away anymore if the <a href="/win-lottery-syndicates/?OL=8&amp;TP1=blog&amp;TP2=&amp;IP=&amp;Prosub_ID=2090&amp;a_bid=9f7cc6b8">X-Factor</a> has begun...Saturday the 29th August marked the first day of Auditions for the X-Factor 2015. This time round there’s certainly some changes to be talked about, for starters the beloved Dermot O'Leary has left the show after a grand 8 years of hosting and has been replaced by Caroline Flack and Olly Murs, this is certainly a controversial change to say the least.</span>

<!--more-->As for the judging panel Louis walsh is no longer on the scene, oh no how could they! But hey the current panel for 2015 is Simon Cowell, Rita Ora, Cheryl Fernandez Versini and Radio 1 host Nick Grimshaw. Ever thought about if you <a href="/win-lottery-syndicates/?OL=8&amp;TP1=blog&amp;TP2=&amp;IP=&amp;Prosub_ID=2090&amp;a_bid=9f7cc6b8">won the lottery</a>, well yeah imagine you could be living life in the plush lane like our competitive judging panel.

This year the judges categories are being chosen by the public and the decisions made are sure to rumble some of our judges. As it stands Simon has the over 25’s, Cheryl is going back to her roots the group's, Rita will be putting the ultimate sass into the girls and Nick will inject some swagger into the boys!

For those who didn’t watch saturday’s episode, there was much speculation over the performance given by the First King’s, a lot of viewers were not <a href="/win-lottery-syndicates/?OL=8&amp;TP1=blog&amp;TP2=&amp;IP=&amp;Prosub_ID=2090&amp;a_bid=9f7cc6b8">sold on</a> the fact they had dancers and a pre-introduction video, was this a fix by the producers? Well, whether or not it was we can’t dispute the sick moves shown on that stage!

<strong><span style="color: #333333;">SO WHO'S GOING TO BOOT CAMP?</span></strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Chloe Paige, 21, astounded the judges with her rendition of Crying For No Reason by Katy B, but it was clear from Chloe’s reaction that she had a reason to cry tears of joy when she <a href="/win-lottery-syndicates/?OL=8&amp;TP1=blog&amp;TP2=&amp;IP=&amp;Prosub_ID=2090&amp;a_bid=9f7cc6b8">received</a> four yes’s from the judges!  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And even more amazing was the ever so eccentric Seann Miley Moore, the 22 year old left the Rita Ora weeping with his <a href="/win-lottery-syndicates/?OL=8&amp;TP1=blog&amp;TP2=&amp;IP=&amp;Prosub_ID=2090&amp;a_bid=9f7cc6b8">powerful</a> version of Queen’s The Show Must Go On… we can’t wait to see what he has in store for boot camp. </span>
