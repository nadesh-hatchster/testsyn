[vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]Hitting our screens on the 4th of September was How the rich get hitched - this eccentric documentary boasts some of most lavish wedding dresses on the market all made by the bespoke wedding designer Caroline Castigliano in her boutique in Knightsbridge. Carolines most <a href="/win-lottery-syndicates/?OL=8&amp;TP1=blog&amp;TP2=&amp;IP=&amp;Prosub_ID=2090&amp;a_bid=9f7cc6b8">expensive</a> gowns come in at an eye-watering £40,000! The channel 4 documentary really highlights how much wedding’s have evolved over the years, most women would rather spend more money on making themselves look perfect on the day than any other element of the wedding! Imagine the money you could splash on your wedding if you won the <a href="/win-lottery-syndicates/?OL=8&amp;TP1=blog&amp;TP2=&amp;IP=&amp;Prosub_ID=2090&amp;a_bid=9f7cc6b8">Lottery...</a> Ladies would you splurge on the perfect dress?

One of Carolines’ most prestigious clients is Iranian socialite, Gissa, 29, her gown is embroidered with 200,000 sequins and 50,000 beads, ooo jazzy! Gissa was lucky enough that her fiance was so generous when it came to <a href="/win-lottery-syndicates/?OL=8&amp;TP1=blog&amp;TP2=&amp;IP=&amp;Prosub_ID=2090&amp;a_bid=9f7cc6b8">splashing the cash</a>, he said "I know this is the most important dress that a woman is going to wear in their lifetime so if you really like it and you love it, we'll get it".

In the world of wedding couture it has become mandatory for any ambitious bride-to-be to enlist the help of a wedding planner… que Bruce Russell the Guru of luxury weddings! However, Bruce’s expertise comes at a hefty cost, he takes 20% of the wedding budget as commission, so if a wedding comes in at £150,000, he’ll get a £30,000 <a href="/win-lottery-syndicates/?OL=8&amp;TP1=blog&amp;TP2=&amp;IP=&amp;Prosub_ID=2090&amp;a_bid=9f7cc6b8">payout</a> - where can we get an application form?!

Another one of Caroline’s clients really lapped up her wedding and took two years off work… a little extreme but I guess if you can afford it then why not!! But, hey we don’t want to give away too much, check out how the other half live on <em>All 4 on demand</em> NOW!

<strong>INTERESTING FACT</strong> One of Caroline’s clients spent £6,000 on her dress including the use of five seamstresses, 200 hours of sewing and £250,000 beads to complete the magnificent garment.
