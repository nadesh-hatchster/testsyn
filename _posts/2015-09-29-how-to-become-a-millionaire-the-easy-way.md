[vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]Have you racked your brain everyday this week wondering why you’re not a <a href="/win-lottery-syndicates/?OL=8&amp;TP1=blog&amp;TP2=&amp;IP=&amp;Prosub_ID=2090&amp;a_bid=9f7cc6b8">millionaire</a> yet? I know we have, so here at Lotto-Social HQ we thought we’d go searching for a get rich quick plan! And it seems it may be easier than we thought...How much junk do you have lying around the house that you’ve not used in the last 5 years? I bet loads, well get it on eBay ASAP and you’ll be laughing in no time.

Linda Lightman, is the real life Guru of eBay, she has turned all her useless second hand items into ‘Linda’s stuff’, a <a href="/win-lottery-syndicates/?OL=8&amp;TP1=blog&amp;TP2=&amp;IP=&amp;Prosub_ID=2090&amp;a_bid=9f7cc6b8">multi-million dollar</a> business. It all started for Linda 15 years ago when she decided to sell her son’s video games, trivial items to most but you know what they say one man’s trash is another man's treasure. A couple years after Linda’s Stuff began, it became too big for just her control and it begun to be more than just solely taking pictures and listing the items. Friends heard about her venture and wanted to be a part of the action, before she knew it her house was full of eBay treasures and Linda was lapping it up.

<strong>3 Easy steps to becoming an eBay expert:</strong>

<strong>1. Do your research</strong>

Find products that fit into the market and the products that the market really desire. However, fortunately for all you keen sellers eBay is one of those places that you can find a buyer for almost anything.

<strong>2. Pick a great user ID</strong>

The aim of the game is to be as memorable as possible to your audience, this means choosing your name wisely as this will stick with you over your eBay career.

<strong>3. Quality imagery</strong>
Think about your customers, they can’t see or touch the item so they rely on the image as a measure of quality. Linda says “It’s also the pictures! Quality is key”.

Linda’s company grew far faster than she could have ever imagined, she moved offices 4 times in less than 7 years! She has gone from 5,000 square foot location to a much larger 93,000 SQ FT! I’m sure Linda’s work ethic is certainly an inspiration to all of us to get all those old items on eBay and hey if it makes you a <a href="/win-lottery-syndicates/?OL=8&amp;TP1=blog&amp;TP2=&amp;IP=&amp;Prosub_ID=2090&amp;a_bid=9f7cc6b8">millionaire</a> then why not have a go?!
