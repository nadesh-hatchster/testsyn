[vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s extremely British and certain to widen our waistlines? It’s no less than Series 6 of The Great British Bake Off! GBBO landed back on our tv screens on the 5th August and we’re so excited to see Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry back and challenging the bakers more than ever. If you won <a href="/win-lottery-syndicates/?OL=8&amp;TP1=blog&amp;TP2=&amp;IP=&amp;Prosub_ID=2090&amp;a_bid=9f7cc6b8">the lottery</a> how would you fancy Paul Hollywood as your personal chef? God we can’t even imagine the indulgence (and the weight gain LOL).</span>

Series 6 introduces 12 new contestants; if you haven’t caught up just yet we’ll give you a short breakdown, so far we’ve had cakes, biscuits &amp; bread, you’d think it would be pretty simple for these far from amateur bakers, but no no you are mistaken! The first <a href="/win-lottery-syndicates/?OL=8&amp;TP1=blog&amp;TP2=&amp;IP=&amp;Prosub_ID=2090&amp;a_bid=9f7cc6b8">showstopper</a> proved a bigger challenge for some of the baker's than first expected, it was that old classic Black Forest Gateau. We certainly had some impeccable bakes that got our tummies rumbling, however, not all the bakers did as well as they thought, poor Dorret’s show stopper was a real FLOP with the judges… no really it actually collapsed!

In week 2 the heat was certainly rising in the bake-off kitchen, <a href="/win-lottery-syndicates/?OL=8&amp;TP1=blog&amp;TP2=&amp;IP=&amp;Prosub_ID=2090&amp;a_bid=9f7cc6b8">Paul Hollywood</a> really tested the contestants with his technical challenge, they were to make the extremely challenging Arlette's, wafer thin puff pastry biscuits with a cinnamon swirl! It was fair to say we had a mixed bag with the outcome but you’ll have to watch week 2 so find out for yourself...

The highlight so far was Paul’s showstopper in week 3, it really was outstanding, 4 types of bread and in the shape of a lion, does it really get much cooler than that?! Paul Hollywood even said he would not attempt the model Paul had made… amazing or what! But hey we don’t want to give too much away so <a href="/win-lottery-syndicates/?OL=8&amp;TP1=blog&amp;TP2=&amp;IP=&amp;Prosub_ID=2090&amp;a_bid=9f7cc6b8">tune in for yourself.</a>

Week 4 is scrummy desserts but will the baker’s crumble under the pressure? You’ll just have to tune into <a href="/win-lottery-syndicates/?OL=8&amp;TP1=blog&amp;TP2=&amp;IP=&amp;Prosub_ID=2090&amp;a_bid=9f7cc6b8">BBC 1 at 8pm Wednesday</a> to find out or catch up on BBC iPlayer.
