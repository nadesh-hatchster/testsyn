The rise of the michelin starred restaurants has certainly come on leaps and bounds in the past few years, us Brits all want to boast about the restaurants we’ve dined in, whether it be 1 or 3 michelin stars it’s still something to rave about to your friends. But i guess we all know unless you have top dollar you have no chance of footing the bill in these exquisite eateries. However, if you was to win the Lottery you’d certainly be able to wine and dine in these establishments. This got us thinking here at Lotto-Social HQ, if money was no object where would you desire to dine; we’ve decided to give you a taster of the most extravagant restaurants around the world if you had a millionaire’s budget.<!--more-->Dinner in the sky, Worldwide

Do you have an appetite for heights? Well I’m sure this interesting take on a restaurant is sure to take your fancy, the concept was originally created in Belgium and essentially consists of eating your food 160ft in the air! A crane is used to hoist guests, a table and wait staff 160 ft up in the air…don’t panic guys everyone is securely strapped in. The price is certain to be sky-high but with the amazing views and set in over 44 countries, we’re 100% sure it will be worth every penny.
