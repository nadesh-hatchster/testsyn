[vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]Do you want to increase your chances of becoming a millionaire? Well the changes to the <a href="http://www.lotto-social.com/enter-details-for-lottery-syndicate-membership?OL=8&amp;TP1=HT&amp;TP2=&amp;IP=&amp;Prosub_ID=2090&amp;a_bid=9f7cc6b8" target="_blank">National Lottery’s Lotto</a> upcoming in October are certain to help that become a possibility! Camelot have claimed the enhancements should give players better odds of becoming a millionaire.

<!--more-->

So, the first major revamp is the increase in the number of balls to pick from, it's on the up from 49 to 59, is this going to shake it up for those players who have played the same numbers for who knows how many years! We certainly hope they pick from the new numbers, who know’s what could happen when you <a href="/win-lottery-syndicates/?OL=8&amp;TP1=HT&amp;TP2=&amp;IP=&amp;Prosub_ID=2090&amp;a_bid=9f7cc6b8">take a risk?!</a>

The new millionaire raffle will guarantee at least one <a href="/win-lottery-syndicates/?OL=8&amp;TP1=HT&amp;TP2=&amp;IP=&amp;Prosub_ID=2090&amp;a_bid=9f7cc6b8">millionaire</a> per draw, and the average winning jackpot is due to be triple the current value…Well we’re sold already. But there’s more adjustments to be made by Camelot, they should increase the lottery player's chances of winning any prize from 1 in 54 to 1 in 9.3. If Lotto players match just two numbers they get a FREE lucky dip ticket for a future draw &amp; who doesn’t like a freebie ay!

All these changes will create over two million prize winners EVERY week! And don’t worry there’s no catch you still pay the usual £2 a week for your Lotto ticket.

However, we’re sorry to let you know the chances of winning the almighty jackpot will go from 1 in 14 million to 1 in 54 million, but hey that’s even more reason to play in a syndicate with Lotto-Social. <a href="/win-lottery-syndicates/?OL=8&amp;TP1=HT&amp;TP2=&amp;IP=&amp;Prosub_ID=2090&amp;a_bid=9f7cc6b8">Lotto-Social</a> gives you more lines = more chances, it's a win win guys!
